Hello! My name is Joel Solomons and I'm currently a **Teaching and Research Associate** at the **University of Plymouth**, where I'm pursuing my PhD in Psychology. My research primarily focuses on cognitive psychology and perception, exploring the intriguing question of why different individuals perceive the same things differently.

In addition to my research, I've been delving into the world of **R programming**. My journey with R extends beyond statistical analysis, encompassing website development, image manipulation, and even artificial intelligence. I have a particular fondness for automation, always looking for ways to make processes more efficient.

But my interests aren't confined to academia and programming. I'm also a passionate **multi-instrumentalist**. My musical journey began at the **Royal College of Music's Junior Department** in London, where I studied for eight years. Today, I play a variety of instruments, including the clarinet, saxophone, bass guitar, guitar, and piano. I'm currently part of a sax quartet and have had the pleasure of performing with numerous bands and groups over the years.
